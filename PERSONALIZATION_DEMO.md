# 🎯 Personalization Demo Guide

This project now includes a **cookie-based personalization system** that tracks user interests and provides personalized product recommendations. Perfect for client demonstrations!

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. **Interest Tracking**
- When you visit any **Article Detail Page**, the system automatically tracks the topics associated with that article
- Topics are stored in a browser cookie with visit counts and timestamps
- Only tracks on non-preview pages (won't skew data during content editing)

### 2. **Product Personalization**
- Products are mapped to topics based on keywords in their names/content
- The **Shop Page** shows personalized recommendations based on your reading history
- Products get "For You" badges when they match your interests strongly

### 3. **Debug Panel**
- A floating debug panel (bottom-right) shows your personalization data in real-time
- View your top interests, recent activity, and raw cookie data
- Clear all data for testing different scenarios

## 🎬 Demo Script for Clients

### **Step 1: Start Fresh**
1. Open the personalization debug panel (bottom right)
2. Click "Clear All Data" if there's existing data
3. Show the shop page - notice "No personalization data yet" message

### **Step 2: Build Interest Profile**
1. Navigate to several articles with different topics (e.g., fitness, health, wellness articles)
2. Show the debug panel updating in real-time with each article visit
3. Visit articles multiple times to increase topic scores

### **Step 3: Demonstrate Personalization**
1. Go to the Shop Page
2. Notice the blue "Personalized Recommendations" panel appears
3. Toggle between "All Products" and "For You" views
4. Point out:
   - Products with "⭐ For You" badges
   - Personalization scores in debug info
   - How product order changes based on interests

### **Step 4: Show Advanced Features**
1. **Interest Summary**: Show how the system tracks multiple topics with different weights
2. **Recency**: Recent interests influence recommendations more
3. **Discovery Mix**: Even personalized view includes some non-personalized items for discovery
4. **Privacy**: All data stored locally in cookies, not on servers

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### **Cookie Structure**
```json
{
  "fitness": {
    "topicName": "Fitness",
    "topicCodename": "fitness", 
    "visitCount": 3,
    "lastVisited": "2025-01-04T12:00:00.000Z",
    "firstVisited": "2025-01-03T10:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### **Product-Topic Mapping**
Currently uses keyword-based mapping:
- "bike" → fitness, outdoor_activities, exercise
- "health" → health_and_wellness, fitness
- "medical" → medical_devices, health_and_wellness

*In production, this would be managed through the CMS with proper taxonomy relationships.*

### **Personalization Scoring**
- Score = (visit count for topic) / (max visits across all topics)
- Products with score > 0.3 get "For You" badges
- Recommendations sorted by relevance score

## 🎯 Client Value Proposition

2. **Better Conversion**: Products matched to user preferences
3. **Privacy-First**: All data stored locally, no server tracking
4. **Easy Integration**: Works with existing CMS structure
